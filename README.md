# Form Validation Project

This project demonstrates a simple HTML form with client-side validation using JavaScript. The form includes fields such as username, email, password, phone number, address, birthdate, and gender, each of which is validated before submission. If any validation fails, the user is prompted with an error message in red.

## Validation Conditions

Username: Required (cannot be empty).
Email: Must be a valid email address.
Password: Must be at least 6 characters long.
Confirm Password: Must match the password.
Phone Number: Must be exactly 10 digits.
Address: Required (cannot be empty).
Birthdate: Required (cannot be empty).
Gender: Must be selected from the dropdown options.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Fill in the form fields with the required information.
3. Submit the form by clicking the "Submit" button.
4. If any information is invalid, an error message will be displayed next to the respective field in red.
5. Once all validations are passed, the form will alert the user that the "User registered".


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the form.
- **CSS (Inline)**: For simple styling, including a black box outline around the form.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side form validation.
